# Solve algorithmic problems with Python

A repository for practicing algorithms with leet-code problems.

The reason I put effort into this is not only to be a good coder but also because I love algorithms.

I don't have good grades or awards.

I don't have a good memory, so I don't memorize all the problems I solve.

Every problem I come across is new to me.

That's why I love algorithms, even if finding a solution takes me a little longer.

Because if I work on the same problem over and over again, I come up with a new solution every time.

I also don't want to end up just solving the problem, I want to develop a clearer and faster solution.

It's an interesting field, and I plan to keep working on algorithms.
